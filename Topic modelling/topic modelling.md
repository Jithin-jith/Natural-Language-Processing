# **Topic Modelling**

- Topic modeling is an unsupervised machine learning technique used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) to automatically discover hidden themes or topics within a collection of texts (corpus).
- A large amount of text data is unlabeled meaning we won't be able to apply supervised learning approaches to create machine learning models for the data

## **How It Works**
- Topic modeling algorithms assume that documents contain a mixture of topics, and each topic is represented by a distribution of words. The goal is to identify these topics and assign them to documents.
- If we have unlabeled data then we can attempt to discover labels.
- In the case of text data, this means attempting to discover clusters of documents,grouped together by topic.
- But in these approaches we don't know the correct topic or right answer.
- Al we know is that the documents clustered together share similar topic ideas.
